    "\n",
    "**3.1. Curriculum**\n",
    "Pathways Academy offers a comprehensive curriculum aligned with State Education Department / Anytown School District standards. Our programs are designed to be rigorous, engaging, and developmentally appropriate, fostering critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Core subjects include English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, World Languages, Visual & Performing Arts, Physical Education & Health. Detailed curriculum guides for each grade level and subject are available upon request or on the school website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2. Grading Policy**\n",
    "Student performance is assessed using a variety of methods, including class participation, assignments, projects, quizzes, and examinations. The grading scale is as follows:\n",
    "*   A: 90-100% (Excellent)\n",
    "*   B: 80-89% (Good)\n",
    "*   C: 70-79% (Satisfactory)\n",

    "Specific grading criteria for each course will be provided by the teacher at the beginning of the semester/year. Grades are updated regularly on the Pathways Parent Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3. Homework**\n",
    "Homework is an integral part of the learning process, reinforcing classroom instruction, developing study skills, and fostering responsibility.\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** To practice skills, prepare for future lessons, extend learning, and encourage independent study.\n",
    "*   **Frequency and Duration:** Will vary by grade level and subject. Teachers will communicate specific homework expectations. As a general guideline:\n",
    "    *   Grades K-2: 10-20 minutes per night\n",
    "    *   Grades 3-5: 30-60 minutes per night\n",
    "    *   Grades 6-8: 1-2 hours per night\n",
    "    *   Grades 9-12: 2-3 hours per night (varies by course load)\n",
    "*   **Late Work:** Policies regarding late submission of homework will be outlined by individual teachers and should be respected. Generally, unexcused late work may result in a grade reduction. Reasonable accommodations will be made for excused absences.\n",
    "*   **Parental Role:** Parents are encouraged to provide a supportive environment for homework, such as a quiet study space and consistent time, but should allow students to complete their own work and develop independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.4. Attendance**\n",
    "Regular and punctual school attendance is essential for academic success. State law requires regular school attendance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **3.4.1. Absences**\n",
    "    *   **Excused Absences:** Include illness, medical/dental appointments (with a note), family emergencies (e.g., death in the immediate family), religious observances, court appearances, and pre-approved educational trips (form required in advance). Parents/guardians must notify the school office by 9:00 AM on the day of absence, stating the reason. A written note or medical certificate is required upon the student's return for absences exceeding two consecutive days.\n",
    "    *   **Unexcused Absences:** Absences not meeting the criteria for excused absences or without proper notification. Excessive unexcused absences (e.g., 3 or more in a month, or 10 in a year) may lead to truancy proceedings as per Anytown School District policy and state law.\n",
    "    *   **Make-up Work:** Students are responsible for obtaining and completing all missed assignments and tests due to excused absences. They should consult with their teachers immediately upon their return to school. Students generally have one day for each day of excused absence to complete make-up work.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **3.4.2. Tardiness**\n",
    "    Students are expected to be in their assigned classroom when the bell rings.\n",
    "    *   **Tardy to School:** Students arriving after the official start time (8:00 AM) must report to the main office for a tardy slip before going to class. Excessive tardiness (e.g., more than 3 unexcused tardies per quarter) may result in disciplinary action.\n",
    "    *   **Tardy to Class:** Repeated tardiness to class will result in disciplinary action by the teacher and/or administration.\n",
    "    *   **Consequences:** May include warnings, lunch detention, after-school detention, parent conferences, or loss of privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **3.4.3. Early Dismissal**\n",
    "    If a student needs to leave school early, a parent/guardian must:\n",
    "    1.  Send a written note to the school office in the morning, or call the office if an unexpected need arises.\n",
    "    2.  Come to the school office to sign the student out. Students will be called from class once the parent/guardian arrives.\n",
    "    Photo identification is required. Only individuals listed on the student's emergency contact form will be permitted to pick up the student unless prior arrangements are made in writing by the parent/guardian. Students are not permitted to leave campus on their own during school hours without official dismissal through the office.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.5. Academic Integrity**\n",
    "Pathways Academy expects all students to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty. Academic dishonesty undermines the educational process and is a serious offense.\n",
    "*   **Plagiarism:** Submitting another person's work (ideas, words, data, or artistic creations) as one's own without proper citation or attribution. This includes copying from the internet, books, or other students.\n",
    "*   **Cheating:** Includes, but is not limited to, copying from another student's work, using unauthorized materials or aids during assessments, illicitly obtaining or distributing test information, or allowing another student to copy one's work.\n",
    "*   **Fabrication:** Inventing information, data, or citations.\n",
    "*   **Collusion:** Unauthorized collaboration on assignments intended to be individual work.\n",
    "*   **Consequences:** Violations of academic integrity will result in disciplinary action. For a first offense, this typically includes a zero on the assignment/test, notification of parents, and a meeting with an administrator. Repeated or severe offenses may lead to suspension, a failing grade in the course, and/or a notation on the student's academic record.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.6. Promotion and Retention**\n",
    "Student promotion to the next grade level is based on successful completion of academic requirements for the current grade, satisfactory attendance, and demonstration of grade-level proficiency in core subjects. Decisions regarding retention are made on an individual basis by a team including teachers, administrators, counselors, and parents/guardians, considering the student's overall academic performance, social-emotional development, and best educational interests. Early communication will occur if a student is at risk of retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.7. Standardized Testing**\n",
    "Students will participate in State Education Department / Anytown School District-mandated standardized tests at various grade levels. These assessments (e.g., state achievement tests, college entrance precursors like PSAT) provide valuable data on student progress, school effectiveness, and help inform instruction. Dates and specific information regarding these tests will be communicated to families well in advance. Students are expected to take these tests seriously and perform to the best of their ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.8. Report Cards & Parent-Teacher Conferences**\n",
    "*   **Report Cards:** Issued four times per year (at the end of each nine-week quarter) to provide a formal evaluation of student progress in each subject.\n",
    "*   **Progress Reports:** Issued mid-quarter for all students, or more frequently for students experiencing academic difficulties or at risk of failing. These are accessible via the Pathways Parent Portal.\n",
    "*   **Parent-Teacher Conferences:** Scheduled formally twice a year (Fall and Spring) to discuss student progress, strengths, and areas for growth. Parents/guardians are strongly encouraged to attend. Additional conferences can be scheduled as needed by contacting the teacher or counselor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "The Pathways Academy Code of Conduct is established to create and maintain a safe, orderly, respectful, and positive learning environment for all members of our school community.

Repeated violations will result in progressive disciplinary action. The administration reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of any attire and make final decisions on dress code matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.5. Bullying, Harassment, and Intimidation**\n",
    "Pathways Academy is firmly committed to providing all students with a safe and civil learning environment free from bullying, harassment, and intimidation. Such behaviors are disruptive to the educational process and will not be tolerated.\n",
    "*   **Definition:**\n",
    "    *   **Bullying:** Any repeated and/or severe aggressive behavior, whether physical, verbal, written, electronic (cyberbullying), or social/relational, that is intended to cause or actually causes harm, fear, or distress to another student. It typically involves an imbalance of power (real or perceived). This includes threats, taunting, teasing, spreading rumors, social exclusion, and physical aggression.\n",
    "    *   **Harassment:** Conduct (verbal, written, physical, or electronic) based on a person's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, disability, or other protected characteristic, that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational environment, or unreasonably interfering with a student's academic performance or participation.\n",
    "    *   **Intimidation:** Behavior that makes someone feel fearful or threatened.\n",

    "*   **Investigation:** All reports will be taken seriously and investigated promptly, thoroughly, and confidentially to the extent possible.\n",
    "*   **Consequences:** Confirmed acts of bullying, harassment, or intimidation will result in appropriate disciplinary action, ranging from counseling and restorative practices to detention, suspension, or expulsion, depending on the severity and frequency of the behavior. Retaliation against anyone who reports or participates in an investigation of such behavior is strictly prohibited and will also result in disciplinary action.\n",
    "*   **Cyberbullying:** Bullying or harassment that occurs via electronic means (e.g., social media, text messages, email, online games) is subject to the same disciplinary consequences, whether it occurs on or off campus, if it creates a hostile school environment or substantially disrupts school operations or the rights of other students to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.6. Prohibited Items**\n",
    "The following items are strictly prohibited on school grounds, school buses, and at all school-sponsored events (on or off campus) to ensure safety and an orderly learning environment:\n",

    "\n",
    "**4.7. Disciplinary Procedures**\n",
    "The goal of discipline at Pathways Academy is to be corrective and educational, helping students understand the impact of their actions, take responsibility, and make better choices in the future.

    "Effective two-way communication is vital for a strong home-school partnership.\n",

    "*   **Scheduling Appointments:** Please schedule appointments in advance via email or phone to ensure that teachers or administrators are available and can give you their undivided attention. Staff are often teaching or in other meetings during the school day.\n",
    "*   **Chain of Communication for Concerns:** If an issue cannot be resolved with the teacher, the general \"chain of command\" for addressing concerns is:\n",
    "    1.  Teacher\n",
    "    2.  School Counselor (if appropriate for the concern)\n",
    "    3.  Assistant Principal\n",
    "    4.  Principal\n",

    "\n",
    "Safe and orderly transportation to and from school is a shared responsibility of students, parents, the school, and the Anytown School District Transportation Department.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10.1. Bus Ridership**\n",
    "School bus transportation is a privilege provided by the Anytown School District Transportation Department for eligible students. Eligibility is typically based on criteria such as living more than 1.5 miles from school (for K-5 students) or 2.0 miles (for 6-12 students), or if a hazardous walking route exists.\n",
    "*   **Bus Rules and Regulations:** For the safety and comfort of all passengers, students must adhere to all bus rules:\n",
    "    *   Arrive at the designated bus stop 5 minutes before the scheduled pickup time. Wait in a safe place, away from the road.\n",
    "    *   Follow the bus driver's directions at all times. The driver is in charge of the bus.\n",
    "    *   Board and exit the bus in an orderly manner, using handrails.\n",
    "    *   Remain seated, facing forward, with feet on the floor while the bus is in motion. Keep aisles clear.\n",

    "    *   No fighting, pushing, bullying, or harassment.\n",
    "    *   Do not damage or deface the bus.\n",
    "    *   Personal electronic devices may be used with headphones at a low volume, at the driver's discretion, but should not be a distraction.\n",
    "*   **Consequences for Misbehavior:** Violations of bus rules may result in warnings, assigned seats, parent contact, temporary or permanent suspension from bus riding privileges, and/or other school disciplinary actions. Serious offenses may be referred to law enforcement. Video cameras may be used on buses to monitor student behavior.\n",
    "*   **Bus Routes and Schedules:** Information on bus routes, stops, and approximate times is available from the school office or directly from the District Transportation Office. These may be adjusted during the year. Parents will be notified of significant changes.\n",
    "*   **Changes to Transportation:** If a student needs to ride a different bus or get off at a different stop, a written note from a parent/guardian must be submitted to the school office for approval in the morning. Approval is subject to space availability on the requested bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10.2. Student Drop-Off and Pick-Up (Carpool / Parent Transport)**\n",
    "To ensure student safety and efficient traffic flow, parents/guardians who transport their children must adhere to the following procedures:\n",
    "*   **Designated Zones:** Use only the designated drop-off and pick-up zones for students. Maps are often provided at the beginning of the year or on the school website. Do not stop or park in fire lanes, bus loading zones, or other restricted areas.\n",
    "*   **Traffic Patterns:** Follow all established traffic patterns, signage, and directions from school staff or volunteers on duty. Pull forward as far as possible in the line to allow more vehicles to load/unload.\n",
    "*   **Safety First:** Students should exit and enter vehicles on the curbside only, away from moving traffic. Have students ready to exit quickly in the morning (backpacks ready, goodbyes said). Parents should remain in their vehicles in the moving line. If you need to enter the building, park in a designated parking spot.\n",
    "*   **Timeliness:** Adhere to school start and end times. Supervision is generally not available for students dropped off excessively early or picked up late, unless they are enrolled in specific before/after school programs.\n",
    "*   **Changes in Pick-Up:** If there is a change in who is picking up your child, or if pick-up arrangements change for the day, please notify the school office in writing (or by phone in an emergency) as early as possible. Photo ID may be required for pick-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10.3. Bicycles, Skateboards, and Scooters**\n",
    "*   **Bicycles:** Students biking to school are strongly encouraged to wear helmets and must follow all traffic laws. Bicycles must be walked (not ridden) on school grounds/sidewalks. Bicycles should be parked and locked in the designated bike racks. The school is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged bicycles.\n",
    "*   **Skateboards, Scooters, Rollerblades/Skates:** For safety reasons, skateboards, scooters, and rollerblades/skates must be walked/carried on school grounds. Upon arrival at school, they must be stored securely in designated bike racks (if applicable and can be locked), the student's locker (if size permits), or checked into the main office during school hours. They are not permitted in classrooms or hallways. The school is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged items.\n",
    "*   Riding these items on school grounds during school hours is prohibited, except as part of an approved school activity.\n",
